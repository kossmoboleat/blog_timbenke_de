monk vs. media addict

"Ding!" sounds your phone. Now you've got three choices:

1. Jump on it to get that [dopamine](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201209/why-were-all-addicted-texts-twitter-and-google) hit
2. Will yourself to ignore it and [keep calm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On)
3. Find a strategy to reduce the interruptions

Often I choose option one and get the reward from my brain, because I've *found* something *new*. If it turns out it's a message that requires a response, quite often I **defer the negative input**. Like any flaw it's much easier to see it in others than yourself. *Planning outings* with my busiest friends has become a real *chore*, because I have to *remember and remind* them, in essence **shouldering their cognitive load**. This is just one example where finding a *strategy* to deal with incoming information is essential, not only to make sure I don't end up too lonely but also to make sure I don't incur the extra *mental toll* on somebody else.

The strategies for dealing with *cognitive load* have a lot in common with dealing with *physical load*. To reduce the strain you can train yourself with more muscles which resembles the second option to build your will power. Obviously you could also just have *fewer stuff*. From plain old *minimalism* this has evolved to *Marie Kondo's cult of tyding up* and it's extreme in *tiny houses*.

There's just one difference between physical and cognitive load: many of our cognitive and digital inputs just *get lost*. Sometimes that's a good thing, but often it's something we cannot recover. This is where note-taking and techniques like GTD come in for me.
